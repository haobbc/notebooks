# **Highlights in Traumatic Brain Injury Research: 2024 Round-up**
A summary of key strategic developments, clinical care advancements, and landmark studies from 2024. 
**Authors:** Virginia Newcombe, Elisa R Zanier 
**Source:** *The Lancet Neurology*, Vol 24, January 2025

# **New Frameworks & Guidelines**

2024 marked the 50th anniversary of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), a cornerstone in assessing patients with impaired consciousness. Building on this, the year saw significant strategic advancements.

* **A New Multidimensional Framework**: The U.S. NINDS initiated a new framework to better characterize TBI by adding blood biomarkers and imaging features to the GCS. The finalized version is expected in 2025.
* **Revised Best Practices**: The American College of Surgeons published updated best practice guidelines for the management of TBI.

# **Acute Care: A Shift in Transfusion Strategy**

Recent findings are challenging the long-held restrictive approach to blood transfusions in TBI patients, who are vulnerable to secondary injury from anemia and hypoxia.

* **Evidence for Liberal Transfusion**: Two major trials suggest moving towards a more liberal transfusion strategy could be beneficial.
* **Trial 1 (Turgeon et al.)**: In 742 patients with moderate-to-severe TBI, a liberal transfusion strategy (hemoglobin ≤10 g/dL) showed a potential, though not statistically significant, reduction in unfavorable outcomes compared to a restrictive one (≤7 g/dL).
* **Trial 2 (Taccone et al.)**: In 850 patients with acute brain injury, a liberal strategy (≤9 g/dL) led to a *significant* reduction in unfavorable outcomes and fewer cerebral ischemic events versus a restrictive strategy (≤7 g/dL).

# **Deeper Insights into Prognosis & Consciousness**

* **Dynamic Disease Trajectories**: A CENTER-TBI study revealed that dynamic changes during the first week of critical care are crucial for prognosis. The analysis used temporal clustering and proteomic biomarkers, moving beyond static admission variables.

* **Covert Awareness**: An international multicenter study found that about 25% of behaviorally unresponsive patients showed brain activation on fMRI or EEG when given cognitive tasks. This higher-than-expected rate underscores the need for a multimodal diagnostic approach.

# **Chronic TBI: Mechanisms & Interventions**

Research in 2024 also shed light on the long-term consequences of TBI.

* **Selective Neuronal Loss**: A study using $^{11}$C-flumazenil PET scans identified selective neuronal loss in the thalamus of chronic TBI patients, which correlated with poorer functional, cognitive, and emotional outcomes. This damage may result from secondary injury mechanisms like transneuronal degeneration.

* **Potential for Cognitive Enhancement**: An elegant study found that methylphenidate modulates the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop, suggesting a potential therapeutic pathway for improving cognition after TBI.

# **The Socioeconomic Burden of TBI**

The profound economic and social impact of TBI was quantified in a large-scale Canadian study.

* **Reduced Income & Employment**: The study of over 18,000 TBI survivors found substantial reductions in personal income and employment after injury.
* **Severity-Dependent Job Loss**: In the first year, complete employment loss was 6.0% for mild, 11.7% for moderate, and 18.4% for severe TBI.
* **High Costs**: Over 10 years, the total cost of TBI on labor market outcomes was estimated at CA$588 million.

# **The Future: Collaborative Research & Trial Design**

Addressing the heterogeneity of TBI remains a challenge for clinical trials. New initiatives offer hope for the future.

* **New Research Networks**: Since 2023, several TBI-specific research networks have launched to improve trials, including TRACK-TBI NET (USA), TBI-reporter (UK), and BRAINapt (Canada).
* **Translational Research**: A major international effort is underway to integrate clinically relevant biomarkers into animal studies, aiming to accelerate the translation of preclinical findings to human therapies.
* **Hope for New Therapies**: These initiatives are poised to improve the targeting of new therapies, enhance recovery, and reduce the societal burden of TBI.
